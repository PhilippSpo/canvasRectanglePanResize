canvasRectanglePanResize
========================
This is a demo of the HTML5 canvas containing selectable, draggable and resizeable rectangles.<br>
The foundation of this demo this great blog article: http://simonsarris.com/blog/510-making-html5-canvas-useful<br>
I optimized the solution by making rectangles only moveable after they were selected and added a resizing feature.<br>
